        <p>From our garden to our table—with no waste and so many nutrients! Roast radishes to bring out their great sweet flavor and soft texture and serve them atop radish greens sautéed with red onion. Garnish with roasted pine nuts or sliced almonds for a little crunch.  </p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
       
            <ul>
                <li> 2 pounds radishes with greens attached</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic, divided</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sea salt </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground white pepper </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 small red onion, julienned</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut greens from radishes. Rinse and soak greens until all grit is removed and the water is clear; set aside to dry. Rinse and dry radishes; cut in half.</li>
            <li>Stir butter, 1 teaspoon garlic, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add radishes and toss to coat. Arrange radishes, cut-sides down, on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until radishes are soft enough to easily cut through with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.            </li>
            <li>While radishes are roasting, heat olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Sauté onion in hot oil until almost soft, about 5 minutes. Add greens and remaining 1 teaspoon garlic. Sauté until greens are wilted, 5 to 8 minutes.            </li>
            <li>Divide sautéed greens and onions among serving plates and top with roasted radishes.</li>
        </ol>
